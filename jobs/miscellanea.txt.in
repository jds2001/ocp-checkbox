 PURPOSE:
   Warning. We could not verify that the system has already completed a 12 hour idle session.
   This test will ask you to verify the system has remained active and booted to an OS for 12+ hours.
 STEPS:
   1. Prior to running this test, you should have attempted to let the machine idle for more than 12 hrs while booted to an OS.
 VERIFICATION:
   1. Select Yes if the system remained on and booted to an operating system for 12 hours without error.
   2. Select No if you have not allowed the system to be on and booted to an operating system for 12 hours.
   3. Select No if you attempted to let the system remain idle for 12 hours and it failed to do so for any reason/

_description:
 PURPOSE:
  Some systems do not share IPMI over all NICs but instead have a dedicated management port directly connected to the BMC.  This test verifies that you have used that port for remote IPMI connections and actions.
 STEPS:
  1. Prior to running the test, you should have configured and used the Dedicated Management Port to remotely power off/on this sytem.
 VERIFICATION:
  Skip this test if this system ONLY uses shared management/ethernet ports OR if this system does not have a BMC (Management Console)
  1. Select Yes if you successfully used IPMI to remotely power this system off and on using the dedicated management port.
  2. Select No if you attempted to use the dedicated management port to remotely power this system off/on and it failed for some reason.
